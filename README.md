# PlaylistSnatcher

# Overview
This project was created to get higher quality music for my speakers for no other reason besides I'm cheap and hate subscription services. it works by using yt-dlp to download youtube videos in the best audio format that it can, which is m4a at the release of this version (1.0.0.).
